     <p>I was born in San Jose C.A March 3rd 2004. My family is Mexico and when I was born just at
      2 months old we went back to Mexico. We came back to the U.S when I was 3 almost about to turn four. 
      of my life I was a only child but when I turned 12 my little brother was born.I went to Cassell 
      elemantary from k-5, I went to Ocala Middle school for 6-8, and finally now I attend William C. Overfelt Highschool.</p>

     I have traveled and visted places (not a lot but some). 
     I have been to San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Mexico, and Chicago. My favorite food would have to mexican food
     like tamales, pozole, enchiladas, and tacos. I want to have a career in software enginerring perhaps but I'm not quite sure but I'm open to anything </p>
