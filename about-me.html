     <p>I was born in San Jose C.A March 3rd 2004. My family is Mexico and when I was born just at
     2 months old we went back to Mexico. We came back to the U.S when I was 3 almost about to turn four. 
     Most of my life I was a only child but when I turned 12 my little brother was born.I went to Cassell 
     elemantary from k-5, I went to Ocala Middle school for 6-8, and finally now I attend William C. Overfelt Highschool.</p>

     I have traveled and visted places (not a lot but some). 
     I have been to San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Mexico, and Chicago. My favorite food would have to mexican food
     like tamales, pozole, enchiladas, and tacos. I want to have a career in software enginerring perhaps but I'm not quite sure but I'm open to anything </p>

  I still don't know exactly what I want to study or major in but I somewhat have an idea. 
  I want to major in Computer science, however I'm still open to other things. 
  Currently I'm in a program called SMASH it helps students from low income nieghboorhoods (like me) know what college life is like. We stay for a month at Standford overnight and we take classes. We learn a  bunch of stuff and we have the oppertunity to explore other careers. The best thing about it is that it's free.   </p>
